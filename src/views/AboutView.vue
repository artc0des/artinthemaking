    <h1 class="text-primary font-bold text-6xl text-center">About Me</h1>
    <p class="text-lettering text-xl mt-10">
      I’m a product-focused creator who thinks about complete lifecycles—from how people will
      actually use what I build to the systems that support seamless delivery. I tend to combine
      technical depth with genuine empathy for users, organizing everything with accessibility and
      clarity in mind. I’m believer in transformation and growth, and I’m motivated by clear goals
      that align with a greater vision and results.<br /><br />

      My technical foundation is strong—9 years working with both back-end and front-end
      technologies along with system design experience across finance and real time data monitoring
      applications. But what makes me different is how I approach problems. I’m a creative at heart
      and I’ve learned to think about the complete user experience first. I organize systems with
      accessibility in mind. I design with genuine empathy for the people using what I create. I see
      technology as a tool to serve people, not as an end in itself.<br /><br />

      Right now, I'm diving deep into Go and Vue.js professionally while exploring the world of app
      creation to help others with something of my own making. So learning some more and sharing
      some more. I'm working toward a life where I can create meaningful impact while maintaining
      autonomy and flexibility—designing both products and a life that align with my values of
      growth, helping others, and intentional creation. <br /><br />
      If you're building something that helps people transform, or if you value thoughtful,
      user-centered creation, <span class="font-bold">let's connect</span>.
